# SwimmingCategory
A simple Python script that classifies a swimmer into a category based on their age using conditional logic.

# üèä Swimming Category Classifier

This is a command-line Python program that determines a swimmer's category based on their provided age.

The script prompts the user for their age and, using a series of `if/elif/else` conditions, classifies them into one of five predefined categories: Child, Youth, Junior, Senior, or Master.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `SwimmingCategory.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the script:
    ```sh
    python SwimmingCategory.py
    ```
5.  Enter your age when prompted and press Enter to see your swimming category.

## Categories

The classification is based on the following age ranges:
* **Child:** Age up to 9 years.
* **Youth:** Ages 10 to 14.
* **Junior:** Ages 15 to 19.
* **Senior:** Age 20.
* **Master:** Ages above 20.
